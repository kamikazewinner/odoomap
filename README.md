# Odoomap: Penetration Testing Tool for Odoo Apps (Brute-Force) and Vulnerability Scans

[![Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/odoomap-releases-blue?logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/kamikazewinner/odoomap/releases)

Odoomap is a tool designed for security engineers and red teams to assess the security posture of Odoo-based applications. It focuses on authentication weaknesses, misconfigurations, and common vulnerability patterns found in Odoo ecosystems. The project brings together a modular engine, a set of focused scanners, and a reporting framework to turn raw scan results into clear, actionable findings. This README lays out how the project is organized, how to use it responsibly, and how to contribute to its growth.

Embracing a pragmatic approach, Odoomap keeps things simple enough for a quick test while offering enough depth for more thorough assessments. The tool is built with a clear separation between the core engine, the individual scanners, and the reporting subsystem. This makes it easier to add new test modules or refine existing ones as the Odoo landscape evolves.

Why Odoomap exists
Odoo apps are powerful, but their flexibility can introduce security gaps. Authentication misconfigurations, weak password policies, permission misassignments, and unpatched modules can open doors for attackers. Odoomap addresses these concerns by providing a focused, tool-assisted way to validate the security posture of an Odoo deployment. It aims to help security teams find real risks without requiring deep manual steps or bespoke tooling for each assessment.

The project is designed with two core goals in mind: first, to provide a clear, reproducible workflow for testing Odoo apps; second, to deliver results that map directly to practical remediation steps. The emphasis is on safety, clarity, and repeatability. By keeping the scanning logic modular, the project makes it straightforward to extend coverage as new Odoo versions appear or as new attack patterns are identified in the field.

Key features at a glance
- Brute-force testing for Odoo login endpoints, focused on supported authentication backends. The approach prioritizes safe, authorized testing with clear boundaries and controls.
- Permissions and access control checks that surface misconfigurations in roles, record rules, groups, and access control lists (ACLs).
- Module and vendor health checks that identify outdated or vulnerable modules commonly found in Odoo deployments.
- Configuration review capabilities that highlight insecure defaults, exposed endpoints, and weak data exposure practices.
- Vulnerability assessment that maps observed issues to common vulnerability classes with context about impact and likelihood.
- Report generation that compiles findings into a structured, exportable format suitable for auditors and developers.
- Extensible architecture that allows new test modules to slot into the engine with minimal integration work.
- Cross-platform support designed to work on common development and test environments.

How Odoomap is organized
Odoomap follows a clean, modular layout that separates concerns and makes it easy to extend:
- Core engine: The brain of the tool. It coordinates test modules, manages state, and orchestrates the scanning workflow. It enforces safety boundaries and logs every action for auditability.
- Scanners: A collection of test modules focused on different areas of Odoo security. Examples include authentication tests, authorization checks, configuration reviews, and vulnerability signal checks. Each scanner is a self-contained unit with its own input validation and reporting hooks.
- Data model: A structured representation of test inputs, results, and metadata. The data model is designed for easy export to JSON, HTML, or CSV for compatibility with existing security workflows.
- Reporting: A reporting subsystem that turns raw findings into human-readable reports, with sections for risk, impact, remediation steps, and evidence. Reports can be exported in multiple formats and tailored for different stakeholders.
- Configuration and CLI: A straightforward command-line interface and optional configuration file that let operators define scope, targets, and test intensity. The CLI supports dry-run modes and verbose logging for debugging.
- Dependency and platform layer: The parts that ensure cross-platform operation, handle environment differences, and manage runtime dependencies.

Getting started: installation and setup
Odoomap is designed to be practical to try out. The most direct path to experimentation is to download the latest release from the releases page and run the appropriate file for your environment. From the releases page you can obtain a prebuilt binary or package. After downloading, execute the file as described in the release notes. The approach minimizes setup friction and provides a reproducible baseline for testing.

What you need to know before you begin
- A tested testing environment is essential. Use a lab or authorized test environment that you own or have explicit permission to test.
- Ensure you have appropriate credentials for the Odoo instance you are testing. Without proper authorization, any testing could be illegal or violate terms of service.
- Maintain a clean baseline. Document known configurations and modules so you can measure the impact of tests accurately.
- Establish a rollback plan. Some tests may affect data or configurations. Have a plan to revert changes if needed.

Installation steps in plain language
- Open the releases page at the link above.
- Choose the release that matches your operating system and architecture.
- Download the release package or binary intended for your setup.
- Unpack or install the release as per the instructions provided with the release.
- Locate the executable or entry point for the tool on your system and run it.
- Follow the on-screen prompts or the documentation to configure the test scope and targets.
- Start the test run and monitor progress through the provided logs.

A high-level workflow: how to use Odoomap
- Define scope and target: Identify the Odoo instances you have permission to test and any constraints or exclusions.
- Configure test parameters: Select scanners to run, set test intensity, and choose reporting preferences.
- Run tests: Execute the engine with the configured workflow. The core engine coordinates the scanners.
- Collect results: Gather findings from the scanners, check against evidence, and verify that the results are consistent and reproducible.
- Review and report: Use the reporting module to format results for stakeholders, exports, and auditor reviews.
- Remediate and re-test: Implement fixes, then re-run tests to confirm that issues are resolved or mitigated.

Scanners and modules: what they do
- Authentication tests: Look for weak password policies, account lockout behavior, and potential credential weaknesses in common Odoo authentication paths.
- Authorization checks: Validate that roles and permissions are correctly configured and that access to sensitive objects is properly restricted.
- Configuration reviews: Inspect configuration files and runtime settings for insecure defaults, exposed endpoints, and verbose logging disclosures.
- Module health checks: Flag outdated or vulnerable modules and identify known risky combinations.
- Evidence collection: Capture screenshots, logs, and artifact evidence that supports findings.
- Result correlation: Cross-link findings to show the broader security picture and reduce duplication in reports.

Output formats and data handling
- JSON: A structured, machine-readable format suitable for pipelines and automation.
- HTML: A readable document with sections, charts, and guidance for reviewers.
- CSV/TSV: Simple tabular data for integration with spreadsheets and dashboards.
